# Math-App
Welcome to my first Django Python - Math App.
This is a simple app with prior knowledge in HTML, CSS, Python and basic of Django framework. 
It is using simplest database - sqlite3 (same as default) and Python 3.
You can check more learning and detail at DjangoProject - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/.
Ensure to create a virtual environment under main folder (Math-App) before you start.

I'm happy if anyone would like to make some contribution to the code. :)

Let's code together!
