Mathlist is a Django app to conduct Web-based Maths questionaires. For each question,
visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers.

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "mathlist" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'mathlist.apps.MathlistConfig',
    ]

2. Include the mathlist URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path('mathlist/',include('mathlist.urls')),

3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the mathlist models.

4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to create a math question and its selection of answers (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
